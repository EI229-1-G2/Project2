% Support vector machine (SVM) is a new pattern recognition method developed on the basis of statistical learning theory. It shows many unique advantages in solving small sample, nonlinear and high-dimensional pattern recognition problems. Handwritten digit recognition is one of the research hotspots with high practical value in image processing and pattern recognition. The MNIST database (Mixed National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits, usually used to train various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. In this paper, the SVM kernel method is used, and the kernel functions such as RBF kernel, linear kernel, Sigmoid kernel and customized second-order norm kernel are used to realize the handwritten digit recognition function. The results show that the accuracy of model recognition obtained by RBF kernel is more than 98\%, which is more satisfactory than other kernel methods. \\
